# GlobalToast

GlobalToast is a plugin that allows mods to send a toast announcement with just one command! ðŸ˜ƒ

## How to use

This is the command list:
```yaml
- /globaltoast
```

There are many ways to display the toast!
```yaml
- /globaltoast (message) -> Sends the toast to the person who runs the command
- /globaltoast (player) (message) -> Sends the toast to the specified player
- /globaltoast everyone (message) -> Sends the toast to everyone in the server
```

You can also edit the toast prefix! Take a look into the plugin's config!

Remember that if you want to use colors in your toasts, you can use &! ðŸ˜‰

## Permissions

The only permission this plugin has is:
```yaml
- globaltoast.use -> Allows you to use the main command
```
